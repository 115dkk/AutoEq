<h2 id="terms-of-service" style="text-align: center;">Terms of Service</h2>
<p>
  AutoEq is a tool intended for creating equalizer settings automatically based on headphone frequency response
  measurements.
</p>
<p>
  The AutoEq service is offered free of charge and "as is" and no guarantees are made about the correctness, quality
  or service level. The service is intended for personal use but also commercial use is permitted. The user is asked
  not to put unnecessary load on the service as the processing takes significant computational capacity and can be
  over-loaded.
</p>
<p>
  The service is based on software code made available at
  <a href="https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Github.com</a>. Bugs and feature
  requests may be submitted via the Github repository's
  <a href="https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/issues" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Issues page</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="privacy-policy" style="text-align: center;">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  AutoEq consists of web-based UI and a server to create equalizer settings based on user's selections in the UI.
</p>
<p>
  The server-side processing only uses measurement data and the user's choices. No personal information is required
  for the processing and therefore no personal information is processed in the service.
